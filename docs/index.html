Unfortunately, the first sections of the book were badly burned in the fire at Ashburnham House in 1731 that destroyed large swaths of the Cotton Collection; however, by putting the two halves of the codex back together, the reader may have some idea of what this magnificent manuscript may have looked like. The order in which each manuscript has been bound has been maintained, along with the relevant page or folio numbers.</p><p><h2>About the Manuscripts</h2></p><p>Fragments thought to derive from the same once-distinguished gospel-book survive in three collections. Two leaves in the British Library (Royal MS 7 C XII, f. 2-3) were signed on f. 2r by Cardinal Wolsey (d. 1530). The volume was dismembered and dispersed, and sections, even then not intact, passed to Archbishop Matthew Parker (1504 - 1575) and Sir Robert Cotton (1571 - 1631). Its origin is unknown, despite the erroneous belief of both collectors that it had been owned by St Augustine at Canterbury. Its Gospel texts link it to the Durham Gospels (cat. 29), but there is no agreement on whether that manuscript originated in Northumbria or Iona. Its canon tables relate structurally to the Book of Kells (TCD, MS 58), associated with Iona and Kells, Co. Meath. Parker trimmed the leaves of the section he acquired (CCCC, MS 197b) to fit the size of the other items in a miscellaneous volume, and reversed the order of Luce and John, so that the eagle formed a grand frontispiece. </p><p>Offsets of arcaded canon tables are visible in BL, MS Royal 7 C XII. <i>Breves causae</i> (chapter headings), etymologies of Hebrew names and <i>Argumenta</i> (prefaces characterising the evangelists) decorated with bands of display lettering survive for Mark in the section acquired by Sir Robert Cotton (BL, MS Cotton MS Otho C V), along with pages of Matthew and Mark. Incomplete texts of Luck and John are in CCCC, MS 197b. Each Gospel was, presumably, prefaced by an evangelist symbol and elaborated opening to the text, but only the eagle and opening words survive from John, and the lion from Mark. Both symbols resemble their counterparts in the Echternach Gospels (cat. 26), while the eagle has parallels in Pictish stone sculpture. </p><p> Labelled as <i>imago aquilae</i>, the eagle (CCCC, MS 197b, p. 245) is placed in frames of red and green, surrounded by protective crosses; or almost surrounded, as the cross which might be anticipated in the lower left corner is absent, perhaps as a result of a miscalculation of space by the artist. The sense of artistic improvisation is reinforced by the use of a page which had been ruled for text. The feathers overlap, and are coloured red, yellow, green and purple in varying sequences along with blank vellum. The tail feathers are marked with fine, striated lines; the head is dotted with yellow on top of a purple ground. </p><p>Mark's lion (Cotton MS Otho C V, f. 27r) is identified as <i>imago leonis</i>. Heat from the Cotton library fire of 1731 has caused such translucence in the vellum that the image is visible on the reverse. Its tongue, forming a cross with its bared teeth, indicated the speaking of scripture. Its fur is represented in such a way that areas of otherwise blank vellus, again filled with striations, give the illusion, ironically, of leaping flames. </p><p>The scripts are expert and balanced, but with errors of transcription in the rubrics and the opening words of John. The script of John's Gospel is distinctive, and separate scribes may have been responsible for each Gospel, though losses and distortion of the vellum make judgements uncertain in the case of Cotton MS Otho C V.</p><div class="foonote"><ul></ul></div></div><!--/span--><div class="col-lg-6"><figure class="figure"><div class="row" style="padding-left:16px;padding-right:16px;"><div class="col-12 col-lg-12"><div id="openseadragonviewerdiv" class="openseadragon"></div></div></div><figcaption style="padding-left:16px;padding-right:16px;" class="figure-caption">Peter Paul Rubens, Saint Bavo is received by Saints Amand and Floribert.
